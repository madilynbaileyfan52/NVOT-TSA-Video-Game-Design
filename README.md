# NVOT-TSA-Video-Game-Design
Hello fellow members! This is the repository that will store all of the files for our project.

## Repository Etiquette
We all would gladly appreciate it if the following rules **were followed at all times**. It just helps in keeping an orderly repository and that benefits all of us in the long term.

  1. Only post files that are relevant to the project.
  2. Please respect each other (this includes not editing someone else's work without their permission).
  3. In order to solve problems as efficiently as possible, follow these directions:
      1. General Issues: Reach out to one of our fellow members on [Slack](https://tsavideogame.slack.com).
      2. Repository Related Issues: Open a GitHub issue using the appropriate template ("Issues" tab above).
      
Violators of the above rules will be politely warned before any corrective action is taken.
